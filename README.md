# Small-Temperature-Project
Instructions
My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live.
For this reason, I chose Berlin to compare temperature with global temperature
To do this, I follow the steps below:

Extract the data from the database. 
Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV..
Ater that I used Excel to check and clean data, I used =average() functon to find moving average in 10 years
Create a line chart that compares Berlin’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).
Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get you started.
Is Berlin hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
“How do the changes in Berlin’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
